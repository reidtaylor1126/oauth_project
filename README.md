# OAuth Project

A project to test possible course material exploring OAuth and related authorization/authentication tools.

## Setup and Usage Instructions

For first-time setup:
1. Create a python virtual environment. This could be done using venv, conda, or skipped entirely if you don't care for your sanity.
2. Install requirements from `requirements.txt` (`pip install -r requirements.txt`)
3. Provide your own database, GitHub, and Google environment variables in `.env.template`, then rename the file to `.env`
4. Run `app.py`
